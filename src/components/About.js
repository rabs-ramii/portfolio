            <li>About</li>
            <p>I am <b>Ram Prakash Chauhan</b>, hailing from the state of <b>Bihar</b>. I was born on <b>17 september 2000</b>.<br/>
                I am presently pursuing <b>MCA with specialisation in Artificial intelligent and Machine Learning</b> from Lakshmi Narayan College of technology University.<br/>
                Moreover, I am proficient as well as a capable and confident person.<br/> I have learned to be very hard-working as well as passionate about my career from the very core.<br/>
                Since my childhood, I have always been trained to focus on my passion.<br/>
                I never pursued bookish knowledge and it is certainly true that only a book doesn`t let you have sufficient experience and knowledge about the practical world.<br/>
                Training myself as a <b>Full-Stack Web Developer and APP Developer</b> and always keeping myself balanced with my career had finally made me reach, where I am today.<br/>
                Recently I am also learning a new course on<b> Artificial Intelligence</b> as well as<b> Machine Learning</b> and I keep trying to win on it too.<br/>
